### Project Description:
In the Lesson 7 Assignment, we built an application that displays the ingredients and instructions to create brownies, which expands when clicking on the headings in index and expands when hovering over the headings in index2. jQuery was used to accomplish the finished product of this assignment. Interactivity was added to the application by using a selector for the currentTarget value, .next(), and .fadeIN(“slow”), which allows the ingredients and instructions to fade in after clicking on the appropriate header. The function $("h3").click(display) is the code that is executes when the header is clicked. A script file and a jquery file were sourced in the main document. Additional animations were made such as having an element toggle slowly and changing the background color of the header when a mouse is hovering over it. The assignments main focus ws for us to utilize jQuery to animate the website and provide more advanced interact features than we have in the past.

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. A lesson I learned in this assignment is what jQuery is and how it is utilized. jQuery is a commonly used library that enables developers to implement common JavaScript tasks with minimal code. There are several cross-browser libraries that are available depending on the browser being used.
2. A lesson I learned in this assignment is that all jQuery code conforms to JavaScript rules, which means a jQuery statement must start with a ‘$’ symbol. This specifies that any code that follows should be interepreted using jQuery library. Alhough it follows JavaScript rules, it uses shortcuts that can look like a different language.
3. A lesson I learned in this assignment is how to specify an event handler with jQuery. You can do this by grouping jQuery statements into functions using the standard syntax. Also, jQuery makes backward-compatible event listener easier because it starts with a ‘$’, specifies the selector for the element and finishes with a method. The event handler performs as described with function in parenthesis. If the parenthesis are empty, it instead fires the indicated event.
